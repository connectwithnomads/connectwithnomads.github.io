            <h2>We are seeking to build up a community of people who live on the go. From our experience, we have found that the people around us were invaluable sources of information about the place in which we were living, especially those who were nomads themselves. Now, we seek to build this community an online presence and make it simple for nomads around the world to connect and interact with one another. We appreciate and take into consideration any comments or suggestions for features you guys might have. Sign up with the interest form to hear upcoming details. - NomadConnect developers</h2>
